## Participating in CLiMB Lab Studies

We're actively building our recruitment pool for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies
of language and cognition in the brain. fMRI is a safe, radiation-free neuroimaging technique that
has yielded foundational insights about brain structure and function. Participants lie in an fMRI
scanner and perform tasks targeting speech comprehension, reading, speaking, memory, problem-solving,
social reasoning, and related functions.

If you would like to join our participant pool, simply fill out 
[this form](https://redcap.stanford.edu/surveys/?s=PP38NEPP7P7LYFEW) (you can remove yourself
at any time).
