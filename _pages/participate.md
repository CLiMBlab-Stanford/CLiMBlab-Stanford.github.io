## Participating in CLiMB Lab Studies

We're actively building our recruitment pool for in-person behavioral studies as well as
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies of language and cognition in the mind and brain.
Behavioral studies involve coming to Stanford's campus to do tasks on a computer or tablet, and participants
can typically be students or non-students. fMRI studies involve coming to one of Stanford's imaging centers
to do tasks while lying in an MRI scanner. fMRI is a safe, non-invasive, radiation-free brain imaging technique that
has yielded foundational insights about brain structure and function. Participants in both kinds of experiments will
perform tasks targeting speech comprehension, reading, speaking, memory, problem-solving,
social reasoning, and related functions. If you might be interested in participating in a study, we encourage you to
sign up for both participant pools below!

If you would like to join our fMRI participant pool, simply fill out 
[this form](https://redcap.stanford.edu/surveys/?s=PP38NEPP7P7LYFEW) (you can remove yourself
at any time).

If you would like to join our behavioral participant pool, we will have a link here soon!
