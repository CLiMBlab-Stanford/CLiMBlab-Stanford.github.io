Past work from the lab has contributed key insights to our understanding of language comprehension. 
Using controlled and naturalistic neuroimaging tasks, we have shown that a variety of linguistic 
processes are supported throughout a distributed brain network that is strikingly selective for 
language, functionally and spatially distinct within individuals from related nearby networks that 
support other dimensions of thinking and perceiving (Shain et al. 2020, 2022, 2023; Shain, Kean, 
et al. 2024), and reliably present in the brain across many task states (Shain and Fedorenko 2025). 
We have shown using a combination of computational modeling, neuroimaging, and behavioral 
experiments that real-time language comprehension is supported by separable processes of 
probabilistic inference and working memory (Shain, Van Schijndel, et al. 2016; Shain 2019; Shain 
et al. 2020, 2022; Shain, Meister, et al. 2024; Shain 2024). We have shown in computational 
simulations how the learning of linguistic regularities can be shaped by joint “use it or lose it” 
pressures to optimize both memory and prediction of the speech stream (Elsner and Shain 2017; Shain 
and Elsner 2019, 2020). We have shown using AI interpretability tools that strikingly abstract 
regularities in natural language grammar reliably control the behavior of statistical language 
models (LMs) with weak innate constraints (Shain, Bryce, et al. 2016; Rozner et al. 2025; Rozner, 
Weissweiler, and Shain 2025). And we have contributed tooling to help scientists make sense of 
complex cognitive processes that unfold continuously in time (Shain and Schuler 2018, 2021; Shain 
2021; Shain and Schuler 2024).

Ongoing research in the lab targets (among other things) the causes and correlates of individual 
variability in functional brain organization, the internal structure of language-related brain 
areas and their connectivity to other brain systems, the relationship between prediction and memory 
during incremental language comprehension, the hidden functional organization of AI models and 
their potential utility as “laboratory animals” in the study of human cognitive functions 
(including language), and the clinical application of preoperative neuroimaging to improve 
sensor placement for language brain prostheses in people whose speech has been impaired by
brain damage.
