## Graduate Students
We are taking graduate students!

Prospective graduate students interested in joining the lab should first apply and be admitted to an
appropriate graduate program at Stanford University. The lab does not directly admit students.

The lab is formally housed in the Linguistics Department, but students with aligned research interests
from any department are welcome. Current Stanford graduate students should 
[contact us](mailto:climblab@stanford.edu) to discuss opportunities.

## Undergraduate Students

The CLiMB Lab strongly supports undergraduate research and welcomes inquiries from Stanford
undergraduates. Undergraduates typically participate in research by contributing to ongoing projects, 
but they can also pursue independent research. Interested undergraduates should
[contact us](mailto:climblab@stanford.edu) to discuss opportunities.

## Postdoctoral Researchers

The lab is not actively soliciting postdoctoral applications at this time, but inquiries from
potential postdoc candidates with aligned research interests are welcome.
[Contact us](mailto:climblab@stanford.edu) to discuss opportunities.

## Staff Research Assistants
The lab is currently fully staffed, but as positions open up we will announce them here.
