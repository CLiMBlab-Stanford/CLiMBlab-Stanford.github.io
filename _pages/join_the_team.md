[Slack](https://climblab.slack.com/) and coming to our 
hybrid lab meetings! Current meeting details are below:

**Time:** Fridays 11am-12:20pm PST)\
**Location:** Margaret Jacks Hall room 048\

## Graduate Students
We are taking graduate students!

Prospective graduate students interested in joining the lab should first apply and be admitted to an
appropriate graduate program at Stanford University. The lab does not directly admit students.

The lab is formally housed in the [Department of Linguistics](https://linguistics.stanford.edu/), 
but students with aligned research interests from any department are welcome. Dr. Shain can be the
primary advisor for graduate students in [Linguistics](https://linguistics.stanford.edu/), 
[Computer Science](https://www.cs.stanford.edu/), [Symbolic Systems](https://symsys.stanford.edu/), and 
[Interdepartmental Neurosciences](https://med.stanford.edu/neurogradprogram.html). Students
in other departments can also be mentored by Dr. Shain, but they may need a primary
in their home department. Current Stanford graduate students should
[contact us](mailto:theclimblab@stanford.edu) to discuss opportunities.

## Undergraduate Students

The CLiMB Lab strongly supports undergraduate research and welcomes involvement by Stanford
undergraduates. Undergraduates typically participate in research by contributing to ongoing projects, and 
they are typically expected to have at least a quarter's worth of active participation either in lab meetings
or in a course taught by Dr. Shain before taking on research responsibilities. If you are a Stanford undergrad
interested in joining the lab, see [lab meetings](#lab-meetings) above for details.

## Postdoctoral Researchers

The lab is not actively soliciting postdoctoral applications at this time, but inquiries from
potential postdoc candidates with aligned research interests are welcome.
[Contact us](mailto:theclimblab@stanford.edu) to discuss opportunities.

## Staff Research Assistants
The lab is currently fully staffed, but as positions open up we will announce them here.

## Interns
We do not currently have capacity to support interns or summer RAships, paid or unpaid.
