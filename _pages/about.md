# CLiMB Lab @ Stanford
## Laboratory for Computation & Language in Minds & Brains

Welcome to the online home of the CLiMB Lab at Stanford! 
The grand goal of the lab is to solve human language comprehension. How do our brains go from sounds to
meanings so effortlessly, and how do they learn this ability from experience? This simple goal presents
immense challenges because understanding language requires understanding the different processes that collectively
constrain it: learning, computation, and brain function. We therefore take an interdisciplinary approach that 
reflects this scope, recruiting trainees from many academic backgrounds (linguistics, computer science, 
psychology, cognitive science, and neuroscience) and building a culture where cross-disciplinary training
and integrative research are the norm: linguists run neuroimaging experiments, computer scientists 
run human behavioral experiments, and neuroscientists study the functional organization of artificial intelligence 
(AI) models.
