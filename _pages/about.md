# CLiMB Lab @ Stanford
## Laboratory for Computation & Language in Minds & Brains

Welcome to the online home of the CLiMB Lab at Stanford! 
The grand goal of the lab is to solve human language comprehension. How do our brains go from sounds to
meanings so effortlessly, and how do they learn this ability from experience? This simple goal presents
immense challenges. Language is a signature of our speciesâ€™ remarkable intelligence, 
and understanding language will require understanding the different processes that collectively constrain 
it: learning, computation, and brain function. We therefore take an interdisciplinary approach that 
reflects this scope, recruiting trainees from many academic backgrounds (linguistics, computer science, 
psychology, cognitive science, and neuroscience) and building a shared lab culture where cross-disciplinary 
training and integrative research are the norm: linguists learn about neuroimaging, computer scientists 
run human behavioral experiments, and psychologists study artificial intelligence (AI) grammar learning.
