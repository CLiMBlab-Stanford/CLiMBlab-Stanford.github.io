# CLiMB Lab @ Stanford
## Laboratory for Computation & Language in Minds & Brains

Welcome to the online home of the CLiMB Lab at Stanford! We are a community of scientists trying to 
figure out how our brains let us go so efficiently from sensation (e.g., speech, reading) to meaning, 
and we do this using a combination of neuroimaging, computer modeling, and behavioral experiments.
