## Stanford's Laboratory for Computation & Language in Minds & Brains (CLiMB Lab)

Welcome to the home page for the CLiMB Lab at Stanford! We are a community of scientists trying to figure out how our brains let us go so efficiently from sensation (e.g., speech, reading) to meaning, and we do this using a combination of neuroimaging, computer modeling, and behavioral experiments. We are a brand new lab and our website is currently under construction, so please check back soon for more.
