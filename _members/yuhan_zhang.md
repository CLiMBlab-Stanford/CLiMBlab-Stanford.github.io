    My research aims to answer how meaning arises in the mind given the inherent complexity in language, cognitive constraints in the processor, and uncertainty in the environment. I leverage toolkits in linguistic theory, Bayesian probability, cognitive neuroscience, and machine learning to establish a coherent theory. I obtained a PhD degree in psycholinguistics from Harvard University with intensive training at MIT.
