    I am currently studying Linguistics, Neuroscience, and Computer Science through the Symbolic Systems B.S. program. My current research interests include action-oriented language and executive function during goal-oriented visuospatial tasks. I'm excited to gain experience with neural imaging techniques and machine learning tools. In the future, I'd like to explore auditory processing of linguistic and musical illusions, with a focus on plasticity and tonal exposure during early development. In my free time, I like to play violin, make short documentary films, and explore nature.
