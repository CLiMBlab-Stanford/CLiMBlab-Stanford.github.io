   I am currently an undergraduate at Stanford, interested in studying computer science and physics. In the realm of computer science, I aim to study the intersection of NLP-centric deep-learning with cognitive neuroscience and computational linguistics to explore how “concepts” structurally manifest within human and artificial neural structures; as such, I’m further interested in AI interpretability. I’m deeply grateful for opportunities to undertake novel research in this ubiquitous field.
